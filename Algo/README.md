# Python + LeetCode **12-Week Curriculum**

---

## **Course Objective**

This is a **beginner-level algorithm course** designed to help students build a strong foundation in basic algorithms and problem-solving skills. Over **12 weeks**, we will focus on practicing essential algorithm problems from **LeetCode**, using **Python** as our programming language.  
The goal of this course is to help students become familiar with Python, improve their coding skills, and prepare for coding interviews and technical assessments.  
By the end of the course, students will have practiced key algorithm patterns and learned strategies to approach coding test problems confidently.
