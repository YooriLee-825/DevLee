# OOP & Algorithm Tutoring

## 1. Introduction

Welcome!  
I am a private tutor specializing in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **Algorithm problem solving**.  
My goal is to help students learn programming in a **clear, simple, and practical** way.  
If you are a beginner or preparing for coding interviews, this course will guide you step by step.  

### What to Expect:
- Easy-to-understand explanations for difficult concepts.
- Step-by-step coding practices and examples.
- Real interview-style problems (LeetCode Blind 75).
- Friendly and supportive learning environment.
